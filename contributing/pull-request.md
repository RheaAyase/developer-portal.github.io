# Pull request

When you have done your work, you can ask us to pull your changes from your copy of the [*content*](https://github.com/developer-portal/content) repository. This is done by using a pull-request function.

Learn more about pull request in the [Creating a pull request guide](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
