# Formal requirements

## Style and Formatting

* Please use `$ sudo ...` for commands requiring root password or root user.
* Use the names of upstream project and files properly - e.g. `Makefile` will have capital M.
* Referencing commands and names of binaries that would be ran in command line should be done using back-ticks ``.
* Add empty lines before and after headlines and code blocks.
* Format headlines as normal sentences e.g. About my program called Program, *not* About My Program Called Program
* Take a look at [Github markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

### Internal links

To reference a page in this repository, use the full path and replace `.md` extension to `.html`:

e.g. to reference `/tech/tools/vagrant/vagrant-libvirt.md` write `[Vagrant with libvirt](/tech/tools/vagrant/vagrant-libvirt.html)`
